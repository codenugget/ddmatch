High:
[ ] Decide what FFT package to pick.
[ ] Read other images than squares.
[ ] Read images of other resolutions.

Convenience:
[ ] Draw the deformed grid

Future:
[ ] Generalize to arbitrary width / height
	INVESTIGATE: Might be required to perform a Chirp Z transform
[ ] gtest: Replace printf() with std::cout to be able to prune the output while running tests?
[ ] cleanup stage (mostly I've bloated the ImageLib with unused functions)
[ ] Profiling

WON'T FIX:
[x] Wrap vec<vec<double>> to something else for efficiency?
  REASON: already done differently
[x] Better console output in example app and add some verbosity flag
  REASON: undesired feature anyway

Done:
[x] Make it possible to run the simplest example
[x] Pythons modulo differs from c++, need to do: ((x % n) + n) % n to make them the work same
[x] Find the bugs
[x] Need to evaluate the proper fourier coefficients at fftn and ifftn
	see: DiffeoFunctionMatching.cpp rows 437, 438, 446, 447
	[x] Investigate how the fourier coefficients are solved in np.fft.fftn abd np.fft.ifftn
[x] Add test cases for core lib
[x] Add gtest to failing function(s)
[x] Add gtest to the project structure
[x] Separate code from example app to ddmatchLib so we can test it
[x] Replace usage of dImage with TGrid<double> in DiffeoFunctionMatching
[x] Replace usage of dImage with TGrid<double> in Diffeo_functions
[x] Fix so it's possible to use const operator[] in TGrid TCube etc
[x] Fix DFT / iDFT
[x] Add properly implemented FFT / iFFT
[x] Seems ICZT contains errors
[x] chirp-z
	[x] Evaluate W^(k^2/2), W^(-k^2/2) and A^(-k)
[x] Add test cases for ZeroPad
[x] Should I use modules in c++ or not? (probably not at this stage)
	NO: We do not want to require c++20 at this stage.
